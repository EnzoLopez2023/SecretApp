## Technical Notes

### **Security**
- All API calls go through your secure backend server
- Plex authentication tokens are handled server-side
- No sensitive information is exposed in the frontend

### **Response Format**
All responses follow this structure:
```json
{
  "data": { /* Plex API response */ },
  "status": 200,
  "statusText": "OK",
  "headers": { /* Response headers */ },
  "url": "/* API endpoint called */",
  "timestamp": "/* When the request was made */"
}
```

### **Error Handling**
- Network errors are displayed in the interface
- Invalid inputs are caught before making requests
- Server errors are shown with status codes and messages

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with Library Statistics to understand your server structure
2. **Use Meaningful Search Terms**: Be specific when searching for content
3. **Note the Keys**: Many endpoints require keys from previous responses
4. **Copy URLs**: The displayed URLs can help you understand the API structure
5. **Check Status Codes**: Green means success, red means there's an issue

## Integration with Other App Features

The Plex API Client works alongside your other app features:
- **Media Library**: Uses the same backend APIs for display
- **AI Assistant**: Can reference the same Plex data for intelligent responses
- **Data Analysis**: JSON responses can be used for further analysis
