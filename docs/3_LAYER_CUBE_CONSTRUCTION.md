# 3-Layer Laminated Cube Construction

## Overview
The "2 Color Woven Pattern" uses a sophisticated 3-layer laminated construction where each visible 2"×2" cube is actually made from three separate layers glued face-to-face.

## Construction Details

### Layer Structure
Each 2"×2" cube consists of:
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Main Color     │  Top Layer (0.666" thick)
│  (e.g., Maple)  │
├─────────────────┤
│  Accent Color   │  Middle Layer (0.666" thick)
│  (e.g., Walnut) │
├─────────────────┤
│  Main Color     │  Bottom Layer (0.666" thick)
│  (e.g., Maple)  │
└─────────────────┘
Total: 2.0" thickness
```

### Material Ratio
- **2:1 Ratio**: Main color to Accent color
- **Why?** Main color is used on both outer layers (top + bottom)
- Accent color is only used in the middle layer

### Piece Dimensions
Each individual layer piece:
- **Thickness**: 0.666" (⅔ inch, or 2/3")
- **Width**: 2"
- **Length**: 2"

### Stock Board Dimensions
Standard stock boards for this pattern:
- **Thickness**: 0.666" (⅔ inch)
- **Width**: 2"
- **Length**: 24" (typical)
- **Yield**: 12 pieces per board (24" ÷ 2" = 12 pieces)

## Example Calculation

### For a 20"W × 16"L Cutting Board

#### Grid Layout
- **Width**: 20" ÷ 2" = 10 cubes wide
- **Length**: 16" ÷ 2" = 8 cubes long
- **Total Cubes**: 10 × 8 = **80 cubes**

#### Piece Count
- Total pieces needed: 80 cubes × 3 layers = **240 pieces**
- Main color pieces: 80 cubes × 2 pieces = **160 pieces**
- Accent color pieces: 80 cubes × 1 piece = **80 pieces**

#### Board Count (from 0.666"T × 2"W × 24"L stock)
- Pieces per board: 24" ÷ 2" = **12 pieces**
- Main color boards: 160 pieces ÷ 12 = 13.33 → **14 boards**
- Accent color boards: 80 pieces ÷ 12 = 6.67 → **7 boards**
- **Total boards needed: 21 boards**

## Visual Appearance

### Top View (Face)
Shows the brick parquet pattern with alternating horizontal and vertical "bricks" (groups of 3 cubes).

### Side View (Edge Grain)
Shows beautiful striped pattern where each cube reveals its 3-layer construction:
```
Main | Accent | Main | Accent | Main | ...
```

### End View
Shows the same 3-layer striping but perpendicular to the side view.

## Construction Process

1. **Rip Stock**: Cut 0.666" thick pieces from rough lumber
2. **Surface**: Plane all pieces to exact 0.666" thickness
3. **Cut to Width**: Rip all pieces to 2" wide
4. **Cut to Length**: Crosscut all pieces to 2" long (yields 12 from each 24" board)
5. **Sort by Color**: Separate main and accent pieces
6. **Glue Layers**: Create 80 three-layer cubes (main/accent/main)
7. **Clamp**: Let glue dry (typically 1-2 hours)
8. **Clean Up**: Sand glue squeeze-out from cubes
9. **Arrange Pattern**: Lay out brick parquet design
10. **Final Glue-Up**: Glue all cubes together to form board
11. **Flatten**: Run through planer or drum sander
12. **Final Sand**: Progressive grits (120, 180, 220)
13. **Finish**: Apply food-safe finish (mineral oil, butcher block conditioner, etc.)

## Wood Recommendations

### High Contrast Combinations
- Maple (light) + Walnut (dark)
- Maple (light) + Purpleheart (purple)
- Maple (light) + Padauk (orange-red)
- Ash (light) + Walnut (dark)

### Medium Contrast
- Oak (medium-light) + Walnut (dark)
- Birch (light-medium) + Cherry (medium-dark)
- Hickory (light tan) + Mahogany (reddish-brown)

### Subtle Contrast
- Maple (cream) + Birch (light tan)
- Cherry (reddish) + Mahogany (reddish-brown)

## Tips & Tricks

### Accuracy is Critical
- All pieces must be **exactly** 0.666" thick for proper lamination
- Use a planer with depth stop for consistency
- Check thickness with calipers frequently

### Grain Direction
- Main color pieces: Horizontal grain
- Accent color pieces: Vertical grain
- Creates 90° grain rotation between adjacent bricks

### Glue-Up Strategy
1. First glue-up: Create all 80 three-layer cubes
2. Let dry completely (overnight is best)
3. Second glue-up: Assemble cubes into full board pattern
4. Use cauls and even clamping pressure

### Safety Considerations
- Use push sticks when ripping thin stock
- Keep blade sharp for clean cuts
- Support long boards with outfeed table
- Wear safety glasses and hearing protection
